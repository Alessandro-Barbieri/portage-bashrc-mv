The portage-bashrc-mv project is meant to be used with the
gentoo portage system and serves two purposes.

1. It provides support for an /etc/portage/bashrc.d directory
in which you can define functions which are executed during emerge phases.

2. It provides the following functionality in /etc/portage/bashrc.d

(a) Support for an /etc/portage/package.cflags file (or directory)
in which you can easily execute tasks or modify variables like CFLAGS
on a per-package basis.
This is similar to using /etc/portage/env but has a more convenient syntax
for e.g. modifying CFLAGS.

(b) Support for removing undesired .la files before installation

(c) Support for removing undesired locales before installation
(similar to app-admin/localepurge, but before installation).


See bashrc.d/README for more details.

For installation, just copy bashrc and bashrc.d into /etc/portage.
There is also an ebuild in the mv overlay (which is available by layman).
