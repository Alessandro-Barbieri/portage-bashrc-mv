Important!

If you use >=portage-2.2.15 and have previously used <portage-bashrc-mv-13
you will get problems, because <portage-bashrc-mv-13 modified EBUILD_PHASE
which has been declared readonly in >=portage-2.2.15, and thus modification
leads to an error abort of portage.
In this case you have to run once

fix-portage-2.2.15 [if you use prefix-portage, use your $EPREFIX as argument]

This command will fix the environment.bz2 files in ${1%/}/var/db/pkg
which were generated with <portage-bashrc-mv-13 and which are
incompatible with the mentioned change in portage-2.2.15

(Unfortunately, it is not possible to fix this in portage-bashrc-mv alone,
since environment.bz2 is used for unmerging, overriding portage-bashrc-mv.)

Execute fix-portage-2.2.15 as the first command after upgrading portage-2.2.15!
